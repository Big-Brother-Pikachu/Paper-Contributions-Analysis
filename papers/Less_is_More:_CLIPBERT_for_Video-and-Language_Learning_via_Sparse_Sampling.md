[**Less is More: CLIPBERT for Video-and-Language Learning via Sparse Sampling**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#4-less-is-more-clipbert-for-video-and-language-learning-via-sparse-sampling)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed a new framework for video-and-language learning called ClipBERT, which enables end-to-end learning from video frame pixels and raw text tokens, instead of from offline-extracted single-modality features. They proposed to use sparse sampling strategy to reduce the resulting increased computation cost.
2. Experiment results show that this framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on text-to-video retrieval task and video question answering task on several datasets.
3. Meticulous studies are conducted to analyze the impact of different components in the framework on efficiency and effectiveness.
