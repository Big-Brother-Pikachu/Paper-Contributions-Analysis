[**Unidentified Video Objects: A Benchmark for Dense, Open-World Segmentation**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#15-unidentified-video-objects-a-benchmark-for-dense-open-world-segmentation)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed UVO (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation in videos. UVO is much more densely annotated and has no predefined taxonomy. Besides, UVO provides a larger range of motions and on average has more significant motion.
2. Experiment results show that UVO can be used for segmentation and tracking tasks, and is compatible and complementary with existing datasets. Additionally, open-world setting and larger motion are the reasons why UVO is more challenging.

# Contributions they claim

1. A method for constructing open-world object segmentation datasets using object interpolation and tracking, which is 4x more efficient than the baseline.
2. We introduce, Unidentified Video Objects (UVO), a new benchmark for open-world object segmentation. Besides shifting the focus to the open-world setup, UVO has approximately 8x more videos compared with DAVIS [31], and 7x more mask (instance) annotations per video compared with YouTube-VOS [49] and YouTube-VIS [50].
3. We provide a comprehensive set of baselines to understand our proposed tasks and benchmark. We believe that UVO is a versatile testbed for open-world object segmentation and will inspire new research directions toward more complex video understanding tasks beyond classification and detection.
