[**Towards Discriminability and Diversity: Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization under Label Insufficient Situations**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#14-towards-discriminability-and-diversity-batch-nuclear-norm-maximization-under-label-insufficient-situations)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization (BNM) to improve both discriminability and diversity of the prediction results. A theoretic analysis is provided to explain the relationship between maximization nuclear-norm and enhancing discriminability and diversity.
2. Experiment results on three typical label insufficient situations, including semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation and unsupervised open domain recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and it can also contribute to existing methods.

# Contributions they claim

1. We theoretically prove that the discriminability and diversity of the prediction output can be measured by Frobenius-norm and rank of the batch output matrix.
2. We propose Batch Nuclear-norm Maximization, which is a new learning paradigm that achieves better discriminability and diversity under label insufficent learning situations.
3. We achieve promising performance on semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation and open domain recognition.

Additionally, BNM can be regarded as an effective module contributing to existing methods.
