[**Pixel-Level Cycle Association: A New Perspective for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#8-pixel-level-cycle-association-a-new-perspective-for-domain-adaptive_semantic_segmentation)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed pixel-level cycle association (PLCA), different from previous image-level methods, to mitigate the domain shift in domain adaptive semantic segmentation task. This new method contrastively strengthens the connections of cycle associated pixel pairs.
2. Spatial aggregation and multi-level association technologies are adopted to regularize training.
3. Experiments on two representative domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmarks verify the effectiveness of this method as well as the contribution of each module.

# Contributions they claim

1. We provide a new perspective to diminish the domain shift via exploiting the abundant pixel-wise similarities. 
2. We propose to build the cross-domain pixel-level association cyclically and contrastively strengthen their connections. Moreover, the gradient can be diffused to the whole target image based on the internal pixel-wise similarities. 
3. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two representative benchmarks.
