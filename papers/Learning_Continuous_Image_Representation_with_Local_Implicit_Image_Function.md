[**Learning Continuous Image Representation with Local Implicit Image Function**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#17-learning-continuous-image-representation-with-local-implicit-image-function)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed Local Implicit Image Function(LIIF), which represents an image in continuous domain.
2. With a self-supervised signal, they can learn this continuous representation via back-propagation.
3. With this representation, they show superior performance on the traditional super-resolution task and a self-designed size-varied ground-truth task.

# Contributions they claim

1. A novel method for representing natural and complex images continuously; 
2. LIIF representation allows extrapolation to even Ã—30 higher resolution which is not presented during training time; 
3. We show LIIF representation is effective for the learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths.

# Contributions in my words modified

1. They proposed Local Implicit Image Function(LIIF), which represents **natural and complex images** in continuous domain.
2. With a self-supervised signal, they can learn this continuous representation via back-propagation.
3. With this representation, they got superior performance on the traditional super-resolution task and a self-designed size-varied-ground-truth task. **Notably, LIIF representation can generalize to much higher precision than the training scales.**
