[**Evidential Deep Learning for Open Set Action Recognition**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#13-evidential-deep-learning-for-open-set-action-recognition)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed a Deep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method to recognize actions in an open testing set. Following Evidential Deep Learning, they proposed a new objective instead of cross-entropy with a head on the top of existing backbone. Besides, a model calibration method and a plug-and-play representation debiasing module are adopted to resolve the over-fitting issue and static bias issue in action recognition.
2. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of this method on open set action recognition task with multiple action recognition models.

# Contributions they claim

1. Our Deep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method performs novel evidential learning to support open set action recognition with principled and efficient uncertainty evaluation.
2. The proposed Evidential Uncertainty Calibration (EUC) and Contrastive Evidential Debiasing (CED) modules effectively mitigate over-confident predictions and static bias problems, respectively.
3. The DEAR method is extensively validated and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models on challenging benchmarks
