[**Towards Open World Object Detection**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#16-towards-open-world-object-detection)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed a novel computer vision problem called: "Open World Object Detection".
2. They formulated this problem, introduced a strong evaluation protocol and provided a novel solution called Open World Object Detector(ORE).
3. Experimental evaluation and ablation studies analysed the efficacy of ORE in open world object detection setting and incremental object detection setting.

# Contributions they claim

1. We introduce a novel problem setting, Open World Object Detection, which models the real-world more closely.
2. We develop a novel methodology, called ORE, based on contrastive clustering, an unknown-aware proposal network and energy based unknown identification to address the challenges of open world detection.
3. We introduce a comprehensive experimental setting, which helps to measure the open world characteristics of an object detector, and benchmark ORE on it against competitive baseline methods.
4. As an interesting by-product, the proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on Incremental Object Detection, even though not primarily designed for it.

# Contributions in my words modified

1. They proposed a novel computer vision problem called: "Open World Object Detection".
2. They formulated this problem, introduced a strong evaluation protocol and provided a novel solution called Open World Object Detector(ORE). **ORE includes an energy-based classifier for unknown detection and a contrastive clustering approach for open world learning.**
3. Experimental evaluation and ablation studies analysed the efficacy of ORE in open world object detection setting and incremental object detection setting.
