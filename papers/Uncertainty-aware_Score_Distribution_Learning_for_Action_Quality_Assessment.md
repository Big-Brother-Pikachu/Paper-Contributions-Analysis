[**Uncertainty-aware Score Distribution Learning for Action Quality Assessment**](https://github.com/Big-Brother-Pikachu/Paper-Contributions-Analysis#12-uncertainty-aware-score-distribution-learning-for-action-quality-assessment)

# Contributions in my words

1. They proposed a new approach for action quality assessment, which concerns the uncertainty of the score label in this task. They regarded the score label as the mean of a distribution. They further devised a multi-path variant to leverage the fine-grained score labels when they are available.
2. Experiment results show that their methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on several action quality assessment benchmarks.

# Contributions they claim

1. We have proposed a new uncertainty-aware score distribution learning (USDL) method for action quality assessment, which aims to address the inherent ambiguity in the score label. 
2. We have devised a multi-path uncertainty-aware score distribution (MUSDL) framework to take advantage of additional fine-grained score labels. 
3. The experiments on three AQA datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.
