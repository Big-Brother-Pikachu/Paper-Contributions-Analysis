# Contributions in my words

1. They built a new dataset called Intentonomy dataset which is aimed at human intent understanding. They carefully selected the intent labels using psychology knowledge and ingeniously designed the annotation process to ensure quality.
2. They used this dataset to analysis how visual content within images contributes to the understanding of human intent. Results showed that different intent categories have different preferences on objects and context, and further, specific objects/context classes. Also, there are some intent classes which visual information only is not enough to describe.
3. Based on the above discoveries, they proposed a novel method for intent recognition with two specific designs. It guided the network to focus on the region of objects and/or contexts according to intent categories. Also it used hashtags to complement visual information. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of this method and verified the effect of each component.
