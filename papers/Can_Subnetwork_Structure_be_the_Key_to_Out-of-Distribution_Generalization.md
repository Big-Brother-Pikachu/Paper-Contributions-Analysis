# Contributions in my words

1. They found a sparse classifier is good for Out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization.
2. Simple Exception Risk Minimization(ERM) trained model has subnetwork that only utilizes non-spurious features. And a modified lottery tickets hypothesis holds that we can re-train the subnetwork with the same initialization values to reach better generalization ability.
3. They proposed a method called Modular Risk Minimization(MRM) to find the desired subnetwork with sparsity regularzation, and retrain the
